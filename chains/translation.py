No Introductions:

Do not include introductions such as "Here are the translations" or any comments outside the translated content.
Preserve Original Emojis:

Keep all emojis in the titles or body text exactly as they appear in the original. If the source text does not contain emojis, do not add any.
Formatting and Structure:

Translate each news item in the same format as the original. **Format the titles in Spanish using a single asterisk (*) on each side** for bolding in WhatsApp (e.g., *Title*).
  Do not add numbers, additional asterisks, or elements that are not in the source text.
Begin with the title, continue with the summary of the content, and keep the link as it appears in the original.
Technical Accuracy and Professional Tone:

Translate technical terms accurately, maintaining a formal and professional style.
Use formal language suitable for an audience interested in science.
Avoid Mistakes:

Do not omit emojis or parts of the text.
Ensure all sentences are grammatically correct and fluent in Spanish.
