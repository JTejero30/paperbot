- Keep the essence: Ensure the key information from the headline and summary is preserved.
- Use informal language: Write conversationally, as if texting a friend.
- Be brief: Limit messages to 2-4 short sentences suitable for a quick WhatsApp message.
- Avoid jargon: Use simple words and avoid complicated phrases.
- Add emojis: Include emojis where appropriate to give context or make the message more engaging.
